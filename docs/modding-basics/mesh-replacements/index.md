# Static Model Replacements

## Prerequisites

 * Unreal Engine 4.27.2 is required
 * A program that can extract assets from UE4 PAK files (FModel, UModel)
 * A program that can pack UE4 files (repak, UnrealPak)
 * Model editing program, such as Blender, Maya, 3ds Max... (needs to support .psk files)
 * Blender plugin for importing .psk files (https://github.com/matyalatte/blender3d_import_psk_psa)
 * Basic knowledge of PBR materials and texture packing

## Extracing models from game files - Introduction

For this, we will be using Fmodel, you can also use Umodel, however Fmodel is the easiest to work with and has better support. We will also be using Blender with the .psk addon.
It's exptected you have an idea how to use Blender and know basics of rigging.

### Using Blender

1. Import the .psk file you exported using [Fmodel](/docs/modding-basics/using-fmodel).
2. Rig the models accordingly if necessary, some models don't have a skeleton or vertex groups.
3. Add 3 addtional empty UV maps. (scale down until they're not visible). This is necessary to remove possible masking being applied to the model.
4. Add an additional empty material assigned to a face, has to be first slot. This is necessary to remove possible masking being applied to the model, however not the case with all models. It's a good habit to include it.
5. Export the model as .FBX with following settings:

![Settings](assets/blender_export.png)

### Importing in Unreal Engine

1. You will need to set up the correct project hierchary, using the Moneybags as example, the hierarchy is as follows: 
`Content/Gameplay/Player/Props/Moneybag_01`
2. Import the .FBX with these settings if you're importing a static mesh:

![Settings](assets/ue_settings.png)

### Creating materials

1. We will be referencing already existing master material in the game.
2. Create project hierarchy:
`Content/MasterMaterial/Vehicles/Helicopter`
3. Create a Material, name it as following `MM_HelicopterInterior`
4. Set up the material as following:

![Master](assets/master_setup.png)

5. Import your textures wherever you wish, they will need to have a specific packing in order to work.

### Packing textures

1. You can use either Substance Painter with an export preset or any image manipulation program.
2. Your texture should be packed as following:

* ` Texture1 - Albedo(RGB)Labels(A)`
   * RGB: - base color/albedo 
   * Alpha: - emission mask
     
* ` Texture2 - BaseNormal(RG)Roughness(B)Metallic(A)`
   * RG: - 2-channel DirectX normal map
   * Blue: - Roughness
   * Alpha: - Metallic

3. Set the Normal texture Compression Settings to Masks/BC7 with sRGB unticked. (BC7 is higher quality but also bigger size.)

### Creating and assigning material instances

1. Create a material instance from the MM_HelicopterInterior material, put it wherever you wish.
2. Open up your model and assign material instances accordingly.

### Cooking and packing

There's a few ways to do this, I will cover the way I personally cook and pack my mods. You can also generate chunks and selectively choose what to pack. 

1. In Unreal Engine, go into File -> Cook Content for Windows. This will cook the content in `YourProjectName\Saved\Cooked`
2. Go in `YouProjectName\Saved\Cooked\WindowsNoEditor\YouProjectName` and copy the Content folder.
3. Paste the Content folder in a different location where your workfolder is located. (You should create some sort of a workfolder for organization, not necessary)
4. Create a folder called pakchunk99-Mods_YourModsName_P. Make another folder called PAYDAY3 inside that folder, then paste in the Content folder you copied inside PAYDAY3. (Mod names can differ, this is just how I personally name them, the `_P` is necessary)
5. Find the master material uasset (MM_HelicopterInterior.uasset) and make sure not to include it in the final mod folder before packing.
6. Create the .pak file, you can either use [UnrealPak, repak or other solutions.](/docs/additional-resources/tools)

### Testing the mod

1. Put the .pak file in the game's Paks directory `PAYDAY3\PAYDAY3\Content\Paks` or the `mods folder`.
2. The model should now appear in-game if you've done everything correctly.
